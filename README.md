# fvCharts
just a simple streamlit app to display a stock's recent price chart and its associated sector/industry charts
* This solves the problem of having multiple steps in getting salient info about a stock
  - checking a stock's chart
  - remembering the stock's sector and checking the sector chart
  - remembering the stock's industry and checking the industry chart
  - going to a separate website (like Yahoo Finance) to find its next earnings date
* 4 steps in a single simple UI

# About
* App deployed over at streamlit sharing (beta as of Jun 2021)
* https://share.streamlit.io/kpteo/fvcharts/main/App.py

## Credits
* Streamlit for base code and hosting on free streamlit share 
* Finviz.com for the most of the data
* Finance.Yahoo.com for earnings date data
